# C++ Module 00

# Concepts:

- namespaces
- `Class` and instance
- `this->` pointer
- member functions
- stdio streams
- encapsulation
- initialization lists
- `static` and `const` keywords

# ex00

A simple C++ program that converts any input text to uppercase, or outputs a default loud noise if no input is provided — a warm-up for basic syntax, `std::string`, and `iostream` usage.

Usage:
```
make
```

```
./megaphone <input text>
```

# ex01

A command-line phonebook application that stores up to 8 contacts, supports adding, searching, and displaying formatted contact info, and practices OOP design with encapsulation.

Usage:
```
make
```

```
./phonebook
```

# ex02

Reconstructed a missing `Account.cpp` implementation from its header and a log file to match expected output, practicing reverse engineering, class design, and static member usage.

Usage:
```
make
```

```
./account
```
